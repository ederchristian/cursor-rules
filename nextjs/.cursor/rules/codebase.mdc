- Main structure:
  - `app/` or `pages/` — routing.
  - `components/` — reusable UI components.
  - `features/` — optional, for feature logic.
  - `queries/` — API fetching.
  - `schemas/` — Zod validation.
  - `utils/` — utilities.
  - `contexts/` — contexts and providers.
  - `hooks/` — reusable hooks.
- Co-locate tests (`*.spec.tsx`) next to components.
