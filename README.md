# Cursor Rules Templates

A collection of `.cursor/rules` templates for personal and professional projects.

Currently includes:

- React + TypeScript
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Elixir + Phoenix + Ecto

## Work in progress

This is an evolving collection of best practices for using [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) with different stacks.

## Acknowledgements

This template was inspired in part by architecture patterns and frontend technologies I explored thanks to my friend [Hugo](https://github.com/hugooliveirad). His approach to tools like Stitches, and the way he uses AI to improve the developer experience, has influenced both my stack and how I write code today.

## Contributions are welcome

If you have ideas or improvements, feel free to open a PR.
