- Main directories:
  - `components/` — reusable components.
  - `pages/` — page/feature components.
  - `queries/` — API fetching.
  - `schemas/` — Zod validation.
  - `utils/` — utilities.
  - `contexts/` — context providers.
  - `hooks/` — custom hooks.
- Keep files small and focused.
- Co-locate tests next to components (`*.spec.tsx`).
