- Use feature-based folder organization.
- Suggested top-level structure under `src/`:
  - `components/` — reusable UI components.
  - `pages/` — feature/page-specific components.
  - `queries/` — API data fetching with Tanstack Query.
  - `schemas/` — Zod schemas.
  - `utils/` — utility functions and custom hooks.
  - `contexts/` — React Contexts and providers.
  - `hooks/` — reusable custom hooks.
- Use Radix UI components for accessible UI primitives.
- Use Stitches for styling.
