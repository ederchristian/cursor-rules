- Main directories:
  - `components/` — reusable components.
  - `screens/` — screen/page components.
  - `navigation/` — navigation setup.
  - `services/` — API and external services.
  - `hooks/` — custom hooks.
  - `utils/` — utilities and helpers.
  - `contexts/` — context providers.
  - `types/` — TypeScript definitions.
  - `constants/` — app constants.
- Keep files small and focused.
- Co-locate tests next to components (`*.spec.tsx` or `*.test.tsx`).
- Use index files for clean imports.
- Separate business logic from UI components.
