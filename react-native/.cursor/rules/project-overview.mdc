- Core stack:
  - React Native 0.72+ (functional components and hooks).
  - TypeScript (strict mode).
  - Expo (preferred) or Metro bundler.
  - React Navigation for navigation.
  - React Native Elements or NativeBase for UI components.
  - Zustand or React Query for state management.
  - Zod for schema validation.
  - React Hook Form for forms.
  - React Native Testing Library + Jest for testing.
  - Detox for E2E tests (optional).
- Development tools:
  - ESLint + Prettier for code formatting.
  - Flipper for debugging (React Native CLI).
  - Expo Dev Tools (Expo projects).
- Architecture:
  - Component-based with feature organization.
  - Clean separation of concerns.
  - Performance-focused (lists, images, navigation).
  - Platform-agnostic with targeted optimizations.
